Registration/login: this is the first comit, other features on the such as 'social login, confirmation/activation email etc' will be added.
The signup page is the home page.other pages include: login page, password rest pages.
On the 'settings.py' file , i have removed the SMTP email configuration, you can input your email and password to test it out.
This is not the template we will be using, looking on getting the functionalities up and working, then we can decide on which template design we will be using.
